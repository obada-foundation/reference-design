## Deploying reference-design

Installation script assumes that you use **Ubuntu 20.04**. The deployment script can be executed from any machine that can run docker, shell and makefiles. Please check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFU4kyESciM) if you need more information about the installation details.

### Install required packages

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io make -y
```

If you don't have a **Debian** based distribution, you need to find a way to install such dependencies on your own.

### Add user to the docker group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After execution of this command you need to reboot your provision server.

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obada-foundation/reference-design
cd reference-design
```

### Generate server certificates into **./ssh** folder

```bash
make certificates
```
After the success certificate generation, add **./ssh/ssh_key.pub** to the server that you want to install the **reference-design**. Below you can find instructions how to add a key for most popular cloud/hosting providers:
